# SmartWaterManagement
This paper presents water management using an IOT device. It is a well-known fact that water is a scarce resource and the world is being deprived of clean water day after day. In order to save water, a person has to come up with a smart idea where there is no wastage of electricity, power, water or any other scarce resource. In order to implement this, the hardware used in this project is NodeMCU, D.C.Motor and ultrasonic sensor and the software used is Arduino, IBM Watson cloud platform and a UI. The prototype made can be used in residential areas to avoid wastage of water. The sensors used help save water from being wasted. The UI created helps control the water flow.
